# Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail
Welcome to the "Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail" project! In this project, we will conduct an EDA on a retail dataset to identify the main reason for loss in the business.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze the retail dataset and identify the main reason for the loss in the business. After analyzing the data, we found that furniture items were the primary cause of loss. Further investigation revealed that the company was providing high discounts on furniture items, which was leading to a reduction in profit margins. This project highlights the importance of conducting EDA to identify the root causes of business problems and make data-driven decisions to improve profitability.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need:

- Power BI Desktop
- Retail sales dataset
## Getting Started
- Download and install Power BI Desktop on your local machine.
- Download the retail sales dataset and save it in a CSV file.
- Open Power BI Desktop and import the dataset.
- Create a visual dashboard using the imported dataset.
## Usage
To use this project, simply open the Power BI file and explore the dashboard. You can modify the dashboard to include additional charts and graphs, or change the data source to work with your own dataset.

## Conclusion
By the end of this project, you will have learned how to use Power BI to create a visual dashboard and gain insights into a retail sales dataset. This project highlights the importance of making data-driven decisions to improve business performance, and how EDA can be used to identify the root causes of business problems. Have fun exploring the possibilities!
