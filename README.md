# The Sparks Foundation Data Analytics Project.
## Task 1: Prediction using Supervised ML.
In this project, we will be working with a dataset consisting of the number of hours studied by a student and their corresponding percentage score. We will use this dataset to train a Supervised Machine Learning model that can predict the percentage of a student based on the number of hours they study.

## Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail
The goal of this project is to analyze the retail dataset and identify the main reason for the loss in the business. After analyzing the data, we found that furniture items were the primary cause of loss. Further investigation revealed that the company was providing high discounts on furniture items, which was leading to a reduction in profit margins. This project highlights the importance of conducting EDA to identify the root causes of business problems and make data-driven decisions to improve profitability.

## Task 3: Prediction using Unsupervised ML
The goal of this project is to predict the optimum number of clusters in the Iris dataset using Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques. We will use the K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster the data points into different groups based on their similarity. We will then use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for the dataset. Finally, we will visualize the clusters using a scatter plot.
