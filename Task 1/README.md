# Prediction using Supervised ML
Welcome to the "Prediction using Supervised ML" project! This is a beginner level project aimed at predicting the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours using Supervised Machine Learning.

## Project Overview
In this project, we will be working with a dataset consisting of the number of hours studied by a student and their corresponding percentage score. We will use this dataset to train a Supervised Machine Learning model that can predict the percentage of a student based on the number of hours they study.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Conclusion
By the end of this project, you will have learned how to build a Supervised Machine Learning model to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of hours they study. Have fun exploring the possibilities!
