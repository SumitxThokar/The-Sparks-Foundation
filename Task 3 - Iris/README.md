# Prediction using Unsupervised ML
Welcome to the "Prediction using Unsupervised ML" project! In this project, we will use the Iris dataset to predict the optimum number of clusters using Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the optimum number of clusters in the Iris dataset using Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques. We will use the K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster the data points into different groups based on their similarity. We will then use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for the dataset. Finally, we will visualize the clusters using a scatter plot.

## Conclusion
By the end of this project, you will have learned how to use Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques to predict the optimum number of clusters in a dataset. This project highlights the importance of using the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters and how visualization can help to better understand the data. Have fun exploring the possibilities!<br>
